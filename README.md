## Introduction

This project was done as my capstone project during my masters degree with Asia Pacific University. With the title of 'Application of Sentiment Analysis in E-Commerce Recommendation Systems', this project presents an application of sentiment analysis into the recommendation mechanism in the e-commerce domain.

## Problem Statement

Spam and irrelevant reviews online can mislead and force buyers to make purchases they would not have made otherwise. By including the sentiment scoring of product reviews as quantification of explicit feedback, it can combine with other implicit feedback like clicks or views in the recommendation engine to help recommend better products to the customers.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is an Amazon outdoors product reviews dataset made available public by Amazon on their AWS repository. You may access the repository [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/readme.html). The dataset have a total of almost 2.3 million observations with 15 variables.
